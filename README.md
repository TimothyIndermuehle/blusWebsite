# Blu's Restaurant, Vail Colorado, Website

I built this website for two reasons initialy.  I was applying to the Techtonic Apprentiecship and need to show them what I was capable of building as a rookie web developer.  This was the second real website I ever built. The second reason was to give to my old boss a thank you gift of an updated website for free.

I utilized the Firefox inspector tools initially to get styling information such as fonts and Coilor schemes from the restaurants old website.  I copied the content and found pictures online representing current menu items.  I made an updated version of the old barely fumctional website.  It was not designed for mobile browser first, a concept I was not aware of at the time.  All in all I think it's incredible for a hobbiest.
